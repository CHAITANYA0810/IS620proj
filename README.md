**Title:** Online Marketplace Database and Operations Development

**Overview:** Our team has been contracted to build the software and database backend for a new online marketplace aiming to compete with the likes of Amazon and Walmart.

The scope includes designing a robust Oracle database, defining schema, and developing PL/SQL procedures for core marketplace operations like managing product listings, storing customer information, enabling ordering, generating invoices, providing personalized recommendations, and producing business intelligence reports.

The work will be executed by a cross-functional team dividing responsibilities across critical phases:

Core Operations Procedures

Securely store and manage customer accounts
Facilitate order processing and billing
Analytics Procedures

Develop recommender system for personalized suggestions
Testing and Deployment

Fix bugs
Deploy to production

**Project Delivery:** The project will be delivered iteratively based on milestones focused on database, operations, and analytic modules. Team members will collaborate on design documentation while owning individual development procedures later consolidated via code reviews.
